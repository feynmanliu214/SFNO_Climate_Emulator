    """
    Context manager for temporarily setting CPU and device RNG states.

    This context manager allows you to temporarily set specific RNG states
    for reproducibility, then automatically restore the original global states.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cpu_rng_state : torch.Tensor
        CPU RNG state to set temporarily
    device_rng_state : torch.Tensor, optional
        Device (CUDA) RNG state to set temporarily. Uses current device.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Save current states
    >>> cpu_state = torch.get_rng_state()
    >>> device_state = torch.cuda.get_rng_state()
    >>>
    >>> # Later, temporarily use those states
    >>> with rng_context(cpu_state, device_state):
    >>>     # Code here uses the provided RNG states
    >>>     x = torch.randn(10)
    >>> # Original RNG states are restored here
